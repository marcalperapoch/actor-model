# actor-model

The aim of this repo is to get an idea of how actor model could work in a Java world.

The source code here is just a proof of concept inspired by the Akka project and it should not be use in any serious project by any reason.

This project is structured in two modules:

* **actor-model-system**: contains the source code for a toolkit that allows to implement the actor model approach.
* **examples**: contains some examples about how to use the toolkit above. See the examples [README](examples/README.md) for more info.
